# emergency-response-voice-bot

My mother is in her late 80's and lives with my sister. She recently fell in her bedroom at night and could not get up or be heard by my sister. She wasn’t discovered until the next morning, and she ended up in the hospital for more than 2 weeks. 

A smart speaker could have possibly alerted the right people to her plight. Unfortunately, my mother no longer has the cognitive acuity to interact with a smart speaker (like Alexa) in the specific format that Alexa requires (e.g., must be “Alexa, Ask [some skill] to Send Help”). Instead, a voicebot can listen to my mother's words and translate them for Alexa or initiate other actions. 

So, natural utterances such as “help”, or “I fell”, or “I need an ambulance”, or crying, or any number of other words, phrases, or sounds can be converted by the voicebot assistant into need help text messages, emails, phone calls, alerts, alarms, etc. and routed to the right applications and people in the required formats. 

Currently, I have a working prototype (Python SW running on a Raspberry Pi 4 processor with external microphone & speaker) that is housed in a 3D printed box. But much more work needs to be done to make it operationally bulletproof. Also, there are many more opportunities to enhance the capabilities of this type of voice bot assistant. For example, think ChatGPT.
